Hannah is a recent graduate of the MA in Psychological Research program at Texas State University. Her research interests focus on how healthcare practices impact mental health outcomes, with a particular emphasis on suicidality and nondisclosure among aging populations. 

Hannah plans to pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology to expand on this work and bridge the gap between the patient experience and clinical practice. 

Outside of research, Hannah enjoys crate-digging for vinyl, spending time in nature, and live music.
