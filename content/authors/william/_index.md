He is firmly committed to serving underrepresented populations and is particularly interested in conducting research that benefits sexual and gender minorities.

William plans to pursue a PhD in Clinical or Health Psychology to continue his research on disordered eating. He previously graduated summa cum laude through the Honors College with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and a minor in Philosophy at Texas State University.

Outside of school, you will most likely find William reading literary classics, playing chess, or gardening.
