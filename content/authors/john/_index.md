He has a passion for education and working with students, stemming from his experience as a Supplemental Instructor during undergrad and teaching through his master’s degree. His research interests include resilience, applied ethics in counseling, cognitive psychology, and psychopathology, with a focus on suicidal behavior. 

Lecturing has helped him grow professionally, with his ultimate goal now being a PhD in Clinical Psychology. He aims to contribute to the PRISM lab's efforts in understanding suicidal behavior in society, while also expanding his own research experience. 

Outside of academia, John am an avid concert-goer, movie buff, history enthusiast, and hobbyist musician. His goal is to maintain a balance between work and play, as he absolutely loves learning and considers himself a lifelong student.
