      text: Research in the PRISM Lab broadly aims to understand, improve the assessment of, and intervene upon processes that confer risk for suicidal ideation, intent, and behaviors. We use a transdiagnostic framework - which means our research spans across and beyond traditional diagnostic categories - to understand (1) contributors to the development and maintenance of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; and (2) when (and under what circumstances) transitions from suicidal thoughts to actions occur. Below, we detail some of our ongoing projects.<br><br><h2><center>Acute Suicidal Crises</center></h2><br>We are interested in understanding the phenomenology, etiology, and time-course of acute suicidal crises, as well as factors that facilitate a transition from suicidal thoughts to actions more broadly. As part of this work, Dr. Rogers has collaborated on teams proposing two potential suicide-specific diagnoses - Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD) and Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) - and co-authored a submission to the DSM Steering Committee. Ongoing work focuses on utilizing intensive longitudinal designs, such as ecological momentary assessment, to understand the nature and time-course of acute suicidal crises. Additionally, the PRISM Lab was recently awarded funding by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (2025 - 2027) to develop and validate brief measures of warning sign for suicide for use in both research and clinical settings.<br><br><u>Illustrative Publications:</u><br><ul><li>61.
