      text: Research in the PRISM Lab broadly aims to understand, improve the assessment of, and intervene upon processes that confer risk for suicidal ideation, intent, and behaviors. We use a transdiagnostic framework - which means our research spans across and beyond traditional diagnostic categories - to understand (1) contributors to the development and maintenance of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; and (2) when (and under what circumstances) transitions from suicidal thoughts to actions occur. Below, we detail some of our ongoing projects.<br><br><h2><center>Acute Suicidal Crises</center></h2><br>(TBA)<br><h2><center>Cognitive Facilitators of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors</center></h2><br>(TBA)<br><h2><center>Ecological Momentary Assessment</center></h2><br>(TBA)<br><h2><center>Measurement and Quantitative Methods</center></h2><br>(TBA)
