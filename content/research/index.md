      text: Research in the PRISM Lab broadly aims to understand, improve the assessment of, and intervene upon processes that confer risk for suicidal ideation, intent, and behaviors. We use a transdiagnostic framework - which means our research spans across and beyond traditional diagnostic categories - to understand (1) contributors to the development and maintenance of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; and (2) when (and under what circumstances) transitions from suicidal thoughts to actions occur. Below, we detail some of our ongoing projects.<br><br>
      
      <h2><center>Acute Suicidal Crises</center></h2>
      <br>
      We are interested in understanding the phenomenology, etiology, and time-course of acute suicidal crises, as well as factors that facilitate a transition from suicidal thoughts to actions more broadly. As part of this work, Dr. Rogers has collaborated on teams proposing two potential suicide-specific diagnoses - Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD) and Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) - and co-authored a submission to the DSM Steering Committee. Ongoing work focuses on utilizing intensive longitudinal designs, such as ecological momentary assessment, to understand the nature and time-course of acute suicidal crises. Additionally, the PRISM Lab was recently awarded funding by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (2025 - 2027) to develop and validate brief measures of warning signs for suicide for use in both research and clinical settings.<br><br>

      <h2><center>Cognitive Facilitators of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors</center></h2>
      <br>
      Several lines of our lab's work focus on how different cognitive factors, including forms of rumination, attentional biases, and psychological closeness to preferred methods, are associated with increases in suicide risk. Dr. Rogers has published several articles examining facets of rumination - and developed and validated a self-report measure assessing suicide-specific rumination - to better understand the role of repetitive negative thinking in relation to suicide-related outcomes. She has also contributed several publications and is currently collecting data to better understand the role of behaviorally assessed cognitive biases in identifying suicide risk. Finally, Dr. Rogers has completed several studies identifying the role of psychological closeness to one's preferred suicide methods in increasing one's suicide risk over time. Our lab plans to continue each of these lines of research in our future studies.<br><br>
