      text: Our research aims to understand, improve the assessment of, and intervene upon processes that confer risk for suicidal ideation, intent, and behaviors. We utilize a transdiagnostic framework to better understand suicide risk, meaning that we do not rely on symptoms from any one (or set) of psychological disorders. <b>Our ultimate goal is to reduce rates of suicidal thoughts, attempts, and deaths.</b><br><br> Our research is guided by two primary questions - <br><br><center><b> 1. What contributes to the development and maintenance of suicidal thoughts?<br>2. When (and under what circumstances) do transitions from suicidal thoughts to actions occur?</b></center><br>Please browse our website to learn more about our ongoing projects, meet the research team, and get involved.
